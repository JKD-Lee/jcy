This is a true introductory level digital sculpting application, intended for easy learning no matter your age or experience. Best of all, it is the true ZBrush sculpting experience – yet free for anyone to use!
ZBrushCoreMini includes the following features:
- Sculptris Pro - Frees you to sculpt without worrying about polygon density or topology.
- 8 Popular Sculpting Brushes - Standard, ClayBuildup, Inflate, Pinch, Move, SnakeHook, Slash3, hPolish (also Smooth, by holding Shift)
- Symmetry
- 2 Base Meshes - Sphere or Block of Stone
- 8 Materials - MatCap Gray, MatCap Red Wax, BasicMaterial, ToyPlastic, SkinShade4, Gold, FlatColor, SilverFoil

iMage3D

ZBrushCoreMini also introduces the new iMage3D variation on the universal GIF and PNG file formats. When you save your work as an iMage3D .GIF or .PNG it can be shared on websites or social media just like any other image. But if downloaded and opened with ZBrushCoreMini the 3D model will be extracted from the image data, ready for viewing from any angle or even further sculpting!

You can of course also export as a normal 2D file that does not included the 3D data.
Viewer Mode

ZBrushCoreMini supports the .ZPR file format and any such file created by ZBrushCoreMini can be opened in ZBrushCore or ZBrush. In addition, .ZPR files created by ZBrushCore can also be opened in ZBrushCoreMini! This uses a special Viewer Mode that allows you to freely rotate the model, try out different materials and export images. You just can’t sculpt on these models.
3D Printing

ZBrushCoreMini includes a 3D Print button that automatically optimizes the model and exports it as an .OBJ file, ready to be loaded into your 3D printer’s slicing software.

Then register for FREE and start sculpting today!
